# TrumpBot
A 3 Layer LSTM written in Keras and trained on a dataset of trumps tweets (fetched from [trumptwitterarchive](trumptwitterarchive.com)) generates trumplike tweets.

This approach is based on [Trung Trans's excellent tutorial](https://chunml.github.io/ChunML.github.io/project/Creating-Text-Generator-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network/).
